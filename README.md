# oldExams
A repository where all the codes written by me from previous exams are stored. 
Some of them might bhe a little clunky or ugly as they were the first i wrote, but i still uploaded them - sorry for that!
All the folders with a readme.txt file are updated and codes are correct.
Sincerly,
  nyck.
