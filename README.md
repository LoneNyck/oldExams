# oldExams
A repository where all the codes written by me from previous exams are stored. 
Most of the codes you will find here are updated and correct. Some of them might not be the best, maybe beacuse I wrote them whe I was still learning and forgot to improve them! Hope they are useful!

Sincerly, nyck.
